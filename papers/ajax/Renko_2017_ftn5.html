<div>Of those six questions, four had an unusually high number of NAs, 44, and a fifth had 41 NA responses. Since we used case-wise elimination, these NAs led to 26 cases being dropped, which otherwise would have been retained. Therefore, in order to retain those cases, for any case where any of the racial self-identification questions were scored as “true”, any NAs in the other racial self-identification questions were forced to “false”. If none of the racial questions were “true”, any NAs were left unchanged.</div>
