        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
          Many individuals in the process of starting a new business—nascent entrepreneurs—never actually found a business. There are many possible reasons that can lead some nascent entrepreneurs to abandon their ideas and others to pursue theirs’ further, such as entrepreneurs’ career reasons and motivations<span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Renko_2017_ftn1.html','ref-target');">{1}</a></span><span class="niljax">{1}</span> for starting up. Perhaps the most commonly thought-of motivation for starting a new business, financial motivation, involves reasons for entrepreneurship that relate to individual’s intention to earn money and achieve financial security. Given the “obvious” importance of financial motive for rent-seeking entrepreneurial activity, it is perhaps surprising that empirical results regarding the relationship between financial motivation and starting a business have been mixed, often failing to establish a relationship between the two. For example, Carter and colleagues (<span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Carter_2003.html','ref-target')">2003</a></span><span class="niljax">2003</span>) find that financial motivation does not distinguish nascent entrepreneurs from the general population. Furthermore, Cassar (<span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Cassar_2007.html','ref-target')">2007</a></span><span class="niljax">2007</span>) finds that financial motivation does not significantly differ between those nascent entrepreneurs who actually start new businesses and those who do not. Zanakis and colleagues (<span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Zanakis_2012.html','ref-target')">2012</a></span><span class="niljax">2012</span>) even find that a strong financial motivation impedes starting an operating business among nascent entrepreneurs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Common to these studies, and numerous others on the topic, is that they focus squarely on what individual entrepreneurs say about factors that motivate them. Simultaneously, there has been an important debate about the relevance of the individual–opportunity nexus in entrepreneurship (<span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Shane_2000.html','ref-target')">Shane and Venkataraman, 2000</a></span><span class="niljax">Shane and Venkataraman, 2000</span>; <span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Sarason_2006.html','ref-target')">Sarason <i>et al.</i>, 2006</a></span><span class="niljax">Sarason <i>et al.</i>, 2006</span>; <span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Gregoire_2012.html','ref-target')">Grégoire and Shepherd, 2012</a></span><span class="niljax">Grégoire and Shepherd, 2012</span>), and the individual–situation nexus in organizational behavior, more generally (<span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Muchinsky_1987.html','ref-target')">Muchinsky and Monahan, 1987</a></span><span class="niljax">Muchinsky and Monahan, 1987</span>). What seems to be missing from the empirical discussion on entrepreneurs' financial motivation is an account of how well the specific situation—call it the business opportunity—matches the economic desires and aspirations of the individual entrepreneur pursuing it. Bird (1988) alluded to this by proposing that ‘alignment’ is important to progress in the entrepreneurial process:
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps one can distinguish entrepreneurs from potential entrepreneurs who… never take appropriate action by examining how key concepts align. Those who implement a new venture are more likely to have concepts of career, work, risk, rewards, and family that align with the venture concept. (<span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Bird_1988.html','ref-target')">Bird 1988</a></span><span class="niljax">Bird 1988</span>, p. 450)
        </p>
        <p>
          In this study we test the idea that entrepreneurs’ financial motivations may become significant predictors of startup progress when they are used together with the nature of the business opportunity to identify the level of alignment between the entrepreneur and that opportunity. We use longitudinal data from the Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics (PSED II) to examine this idea by studying the influence on establishing a business of the alignment between the nascent entrepreneur's level of financial motivation and the revenue expectations for the opportunity.

      <section id="hypotheses">
        <h1>Hypothesis</h1>
        <p>&hellip;</p>
        <p>
          In sum, separate streams of research converge to suggest that you should be able to predict the creation of a new firm by examining the alignment of expectations and motivations (<span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Bird_1988.html','ref-target')">Bird, 1988</a></span><span class="niljax">Bird, 1988</span>; <span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Muchinsky_1987.html','ref-target')">Muchinsky and Monahan, 1987</a></span><span class="niljax">Muchinsky and Monahan, 1987</span>; <span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/McMullen_2006.html','ref-target')">McMullen and Shepherd, 2006</a></span><span class="niljax">McMullen and Shepherd, 2006</span>). However, while a motivation-expectation misalignment would work to prevent a new firm, a proper alignment would merely allow it. This “necessary but not sufficient” nature of motivation-expectation alignment would mean that the impact of misalignment would be greater than the impact of alignment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our hypothesis is therefore in the negative:
        </p>
        <span class="hypothesis">
          <p>
          Hypothesis: The less aligned a nascent entrepreneur’s financial motivation is with the expected financial reward from the business opportunity, the lower the likelihood of starting a business.
          </p>
        </span>
        <p>
          We sought to empirically confirm or deny this proposition using data from the PSED. We examined the influence on new venture implementation of the discrepancy between the level of financial motivation and the amount of revenue expected. A low discrepancy would indicate an alignment of motivations and expectations.
        </p>

          <h2>Sample</h2>
          <p>
          The PSED-II data were modeled as a response surface of a logistic multivariate regression which quantified effects along two dimensions. The influence of motivation-expectation alignment is comprised by the slope and curvature along the line of alignment, along with the slope and curvature along the line of misalignment. The PSED identifies and surveys nascent entrepreneurs in the process of starting new ventures, overcoming potential survivorship and recall biases (<span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Gartner_2004.html','ref-target')">Gartner <i>et al.</i>, 2004</a></span><span class="niljax">Gartner <i>et al.</i>, 2004</span>). Data are available from the initial data collection round (A) and five follow-up waves (B–F) with the same nascent entrepreneurs. Each wave was completed approximately 1 year apart.<span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Renko_2017_ftn2.html','ref-target');">{2}</a></span><span class="niljax">{2}</span>
        </p>
          <p>
          This study included all six “waves” of data collection. There are 1214 cases, but after dropping missing data on a case-wise basis, the analysis examined 1128 cases.

          There was an adequate internal consistency (&alpha; = 0.79) between the three questions. These three responses were combined into a single variable by taking the mean of the three responses, and center-shifting that value. The resulting variable ranged from -2 to +2.

              Respondents were asked, “Once this new business is operational, what is the total revenue or income expected in the first twelve months of operation?” in every wave of the PSED (AT2-FT2). So, there were cases with multiple responses. Presumably the accuracy of the estimation should improve over time. This refinement in estimations is apparent in the increasing correlation of responses between waves (all correlations are statistically significant at p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.001)<span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Renko_2017_ftn4.html','ref-target');">{4}</a></span><span class="niljax">{4}</span>.&nbsp; Therefore, the most recent non-NA response was used as the expected revenue for each case; this last response occurred in wave A in 44% of cases.&nbsp; It occurred in waves B-F for 20%, 11%, 6%, 6%, and 13% of cases, respectively.&nbsp; The values of expected revenues were non-normally distributed. To correct for this, all non-zero responses were converted to a base-10 log. The response was 0 for fifteen cases, which were included in the analysis.
            </p>
            <p>
              The log-responses were then converted to z-scores, resulting in the expected revenue variable.

              There were six questions which allowed respondents to self-identify their racial/ethic background (AH3_1, AH4a_1, AH4b_1, AH4d_1, AH4e_1, and AH4f_1).<span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Renko_2017_ftn5.html','ref-target');">{5}</a></span><span class="niljax">{5}</span>

              The questionnaire allows for five levels of response for marital status (AH5_1). For simplicity, these were reduced to two dummy variables. The first (Cmar) identifies if the respondent is currently married. The second (Nmar) identifies if the respondent has never been married. The implicit third state (both “false”) combines the rest of the levels.

            In order to examine the hypothesis, multivariate regression models were employed (<span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Edwards_1993.html','ref-target')">Edwards and Parry, 1993</a></span><span class="niljax">Edwards and Parry, 1993</span>). As the dependent variable (New firm) is binary, logistic regression models were used; in all, five models were tested. All models had n=1128.

          <p class="ellipsis">&hellip;</p>
          <p>
            The null deviance for all the models was 1159.8, while the individual model's residual deviance ranged from 1135.1 for the Controls Only Model to 1097.3 for the Response Surface Model. Since these are descriptive models, the margin of difference between the residual deviances of the models and the null model's residual deviance is not as important as the direction, and all the models offered a superior fit to the data compared to the null model, while the Response Surface Model fit the best.
          </p>

            It is possible that the nascent process impacts revenue expectations, making expectations more positive for those individuals who are making progress towards a positive outcome (new firm start) and receiving encouraging feedback on the way there. In our main models we measure revenue expectations at the latest stage when they are reported in order to capture the most precise revenue estimates. This, however, means that some of those estimates may have been influenced by positive / negative feedback during the nascent process. <i>Post hoc</i>, we explored these possible influences and observed, first of all, that regardless of the ultimate outcome of the nascent process, revenue expectations adjust significantly downwards as time passes. This happens to both those entrepreneurs that eventually manage to start a business, and those who do not. This points to the likely development where all entrepreneurs’ estimates for their future business revenue become more accurate (realistic) over time. Second, we re-ran the logistic regression model with revenue expectation data captured at the time of the first PSED interview only (Wave A). The results remained starkly similar to those reported&hellip; for the main data.

            The response surface was calculated using the coefficients from the Response Surface Model for the variables of interest.&nbsp; To interpret the response surface we looked at the slope and curvature along the lines of maximum alignment and misalignment.&nbsp; The statistical significance of each of these was determined from the standard-errors and covariances of the independent variables, using standard methodology (<span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Edwards_1993.html','ref-target')">e.g., Edwards and Parry, 1993</a></span><span class="niljax">e.g., Edwards and Parry, 1993</span>; <span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Atwater_2005.html','ref-target')">Atwater <i>et al.</i>, 2005</a></span><span class="niljax">Atwater <i>et al.</i>, 2005</span>; <span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Shanock_2010.html','ref-target')">Shanock <i>et al.</i>, 2010</a></span><span class="niljax">Shanock <i>et al.</i>, 2010</span>).

            <h3>Slope and curvature – Alignment (figure 2a)</h3>
            <p>
          The line highlighted in Figure 2a is the line of maximum alignment. The slope of this line of alignment is quantified as the sum of the coefficients of the first-order variables. For our model this was 0.555 (p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;.01). This statistically significant result indicates whether the impact of alignment is linear or not, when considered along with the line's curvature.
        </p>
            <p>
          The curvature of the line of alignment is quantified as the sum of the coefficients of the second-order and cross-product variables.&nbsp; For our model this was -0.300 (p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;.05).&nbsp; The negative, statistically significant result for the curvature in combination with the statistically significant result for the slope indicates that the alignment of financial motive and expected revenue impact the probability of a new firm in a non-linear way. Since the curvature is negative, the curve of the line is concave, and grows steeper with the increase in the magnitude of the variables.

            <h3>Slope and curvature – Misalignment (figure 2b)</h3>
            <p>
          The line highlighted in Figure 2b is the line of maximum misalignment. The slope of this line of misalignment is quantified as the difference of the coefficients of the first-order variables. For our model this was -0.347 (p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;.05).&nbsp; This statistically significant result indicates that when there is a misalignment between financial motivation and revenue expectation, the direction of the discrepancy matters. Having a negative slope means that the impact of misalignment is greater when financial motivation exceeds revenue expectations than when revenue expectations exceed financial motivation.
        </p>
            <p>
          The curvature of the line of misalignment is quantified as the sum of the coefficients of the second-order variables less the coefficient of the cross-product variable.&nbsp; For our model this was -0.385 (p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;.05). This statistically significant result indicates that the impact of a misalignment between financial motivation and revenue expectation increases as the size of that misalignment increases.<a name="curvature-of-centered-motivelog-revenue-" id="curvature-of-centered-motivelog-revenue-"></a>

            <p>
          As with the logistic regression, we also ran a <i>post hoc</i> response surface analysis using only Wave A revenue expectation data. In this, two of the four coefficients of the analysis were not statistically significant. This is most likely due to the wave A responses including a greater degree of random error (less precise estimates for revenue) than the last responses used in the main analysis.

          In terms of methodology, we have demonstrated that response-surface analysis is a useful way to account for the heterogeneity of opportunities in an examination of the entrepreneurial phenomenon.&nbsp; Where-as entrepreneur-side-only research found no significant influence of financial motivations (Cassar 2007), our “dualistic” approach does indeed provide additional insight, as predicted by Sarason <i>et</i> <i>al.</i> (2006). Because of our reliance on the secondary PSED data, we were only able to test the alignment hypothesis regarding financial motivation. A number of other important entrepreneurial motivations have been identified in previous literature, such as self-realization, recognition, innovation, and independence (<span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Edelman_2010.html','ref-target')">Edelman <i>et al.</i>, 2010</a></span><span class="niljax">Edelman <i>et al.</i>, 2010</span>). Future research should look into alignment between these types of motivations and related, relevant opportunity characteristics to further confirm our findings.
