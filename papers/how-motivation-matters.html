      <h1>How motivation matters: Conceptual alignment of individual and opportunity as a predictor of starting up</h1>
      <section id="introduction">
        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Many individuals in the process of starting a new business—nascent entrepreneurs—never actually found a business. There are many possible reasons that can lead some nascent entrepreneurs to abandon their ideas and others to pursue theirs’ further, such as entrepreneurs’ career reasons and motivations<span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Renko_2017_ftn1.html','ref-target');">{1}</a></span><span class="niljax">{1}</span> for starting up. Perhaps the most commonly thought-of motivation for starting a new business, financial motivation, involves reasons for entrepreneurship that relate to individual’s intention to earn money and achieve financial security. Given the “obvious” importance of financial motive for rent-seeking entrepreneurial activity, it is perhaps surprising that empirical results regarding the relationship between financial motivation and starting a business have been mixed, often failing to establish a relationship between the two. For example, Carter and colleagues (<span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Carter_2003.html','ref-target')">2003</a></span><span class="niljax">2003</span>) find that financial motivation does not distinguish nascent entrepreneurs from the general population. Furthermore, Cassar (<span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Cassar_2007.html','ref-target')">2007</a></span><span class="niljax">2007</span>) finds that financial motivation does not significantly differ between those nascent entrepreneurs who actually start new businesses and those who do not. Zanakis and colleagues (<span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Zanakis_2012.html','ref-target')">2012</a></span><span class="niljax">2012</span>) even find that a strong financial motivation impedes starting an operating business among nascent entrepreneurs.</p>
        <p>Common to these studies, and numerous others on the topic, is that they focus squarely on what individual entrepreneurs say about factors that motivate them. Simultaneously, there has been an important debate about the relevance of the individual–opportunity nexus in entrepreneurship (<span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Shane_2000.html','ref-target')">Shane and Venkataraman, 2000</a></span><span class="niljax">Shane and Venkataraman, 2000</span>; <span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Sarason_2006.html','ref-target')">Sarason <i>et al.</i>, 2006</a></span><span class="niljax">Sarason <i>et al.</i>, 2006</span>; <span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Gregoire_2012.html','ref-target')">Grégoire and Shepherd, 2012</a></span><span class="niljax">Grégoire and Shepherd, 2012</span>), and the individual–situation nexus in organizational behavior, more generally (<span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Muchinsky_1987.html','ref-target')">Muchinsky and Monahan, 1987</a></span><span class="niljax">Muchinsky and Monahan, 1987</span>). What seems to be missing from the empirical discussion on entrepreneurs' financial motivation is an account of how well the specific situation—call it the business opportunity—matches the economic desires and aspirations of the individual entrepreneur pursuing it. Bird (1988) alluded to this by proposing that ‘alignment’ is important to progress in the entrepreneurial process:</p>
        <p>Perhaps one can distinguish entrepreneurs from potential entrepreneurs who… never take appropriate action by examining how key concepts align. Those who implement a new venture are more likely to have concepts of career, work, risk, rewards, and family that align with the venture concept. (<span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Bird_1988.html','ref-target')">Bird 1988</a></span><span class="niljax">Bird 1988</span>, p. 450)</p>
        <p>In this study we test the idea that entrepreneurs’ financial motivations may become significant predictors of startup progress when they are used together with the nature of the business opportunity to identify the level of alignment between the entrepreneur and that opportunity. We use longitudinal data from the Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics (PSED II) to examine this idea by studying the influence on establishing a business of the alignment between the nascent entrepreneur's level of financial motivation and the revenue expectations for the opportunity.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="hypotheses">
        <h1>Hypothesis</h1>
        <p>Not all individuals are eager to pursue entrepreneurial opportunities they identify (<span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/McMullen_2006.html','ref-target')">McMullen and Shepherd, 2006</a></span><span class="niljax">McMullen and Shepherd, 2006</span>). That there needs to be alignment between the individual entrepreneur’s characteristics and the opportunity they have identified for progress to be made, has been widely discussed in previous literature (<span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Sarason_2006.html','ref-target')">Sarason <i>et al.</i>, 2006</a></span><span class="niljax">Sarason <i>et al.</i>, 2006</span>; <span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/McMullen_2006.html','ref-target')">McMullen and Shepherd, 2006</a></span><span class="niljax">McMullen and Shepherd, 2006</span>; <span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Gregoire_2012.html','ref-target')">Grégoire and Shepherd, 2012</a></span><span class="niljax">Grégoire and Shepherd, 2012</span>). There is an interrelationship between a specific person and a specific opportunity, and therefore, “Treating the entrepreneur and the entrepreneurial opportunity as a duality… provides insights into the nature of the phenomenon and the research methodologies that might be most appropriate” (<span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Sarason_2006.html','ref-target')">Sarason <i>et al.</i>, 2006</a></span><span class="niljax">Sarason <i>et al.</i>, 2006</span>). However, this tenet has not, it seems, made its way to the empirical tests of entrepreneurial motivation.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A person–opportunity fit construct should be important for entrepreneurs. The “fit” construct is well-established in the areas of organizational behavior and organizational psychology. It has been used to examine the interaction of employee needs and values, on one hand, and organizational characteristics, on the other hand (<span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Edwards_2006.html','ref-target')">Edwards <i>et al.</i>, 2006</a></span><span class="niljax">Edwards <i>et al.</i>, 2006</span>). As such, this line of research has demonstrated that when an individual’s characteristics are aligned with the values of the organization they work for, and their specific job, they are likely to be more committed,&nbsp; more satisfied, and to perform better than when there is a misalignment (<span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Kristof‐Brown_2005.html','ref-target')">Kristof‐Brown <i>et al.</i>, 2005</a></span><span class="niljax">Kristof‐Brown <i>et al.</i>, 2005</span>). In the context of organizations in emergence (nascent entrepreneurship), this theorizing on fit could suggest that the better aligned the entrepreneurs’ personal goals and motivations are with the type of business opportunity they are pursuing, the more likely they should be to persist and perform, leading to business launch. For example, a nascent entrepreneur who has revenue- and-profit goals in mind that would allow them to “upgrade” their lifestyle, is not likely interested in pursuing an opportunity that cannot meet these financial goals. Despite the obvious need to consider the alignment between what the entrepreneur wants and what the opportunity represents, scholarship on the fit between entrepreneur and opportunity has largely focused on the fit of the entrepreneur's characteristics with the process of entrepreneurship in general, (<span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Markman_2003.html','ref-target')">Markman and Baron, 2003</a></span><span class="niljax">Markman and Baron, 2003</span>) rather than the opportunity itself.&nbsp; And, when the heterogeneity of opportunities has been included in fit models (<span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Hurt_2011.html','ref-target')">e.g., Hurt and Serviere-Munoz, 2011</a></span><span class="niljax">e.g., Hurt and Serviere-Munoz, 2011</span>), entrepreneur's motivations have been missing,</p>
        <p>In sum, separate streams of research converge to suggest that you should be able to predict the creation of a new firm by examining the alignment of expectations and motivations (<span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Bird_1988.html','ref-target')">Bird, 1988</a></span><span class="niljax">Bird, 1988</span>; <span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Muchinsky_1987.html','ref-target')">Muchinsky and Monahan, 1987</a></span><span class="niljax">Muchinsky and Monahan, 1987</span>; <span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/McMullen_2006.html','ref-target')">McMullen and Shepherd, 2006</a></span><span class="niljax">McMullen and Shepherd, 2006</span>). However, while a motivation-expectation misalignment would work to prevent a new firm, a proper alignment would merely allow it. This “necessary but not sufficient” nature of motivation-expectation alignment would mean that the impact of misalignment would be greater than the impact of alignment.</p>
        <p>Our hypothesis is therefore in the negative:</p>
        <span class="hypothesis">
          <p>Hypothesis: The less aligned a nascent entrepreneur’s financial motivation is with the expected financial reward from the business opportunity, the lower the likelihood of starting a business.</p>
        </span>
        <p>We sought to empirically confirm or deny this proposition using data from the PSED. We examined the influence on new venture implementation of the discrepancy between the level of financial motivation and the amount of revenue expected. A low discrepancy would indicate an alignment of motivations and expectations.</p>

          <h2>Sample</h2>
          <p>The PSED-II data were modeled as a response surface of a logistic multivariate regression which quantified effects along two dimensions. The influence of motivation-expectation alignment is comprised by the slope and curvature along the line of alignment, along with the slope and curvature along the line of misalignment. The PSED identifies and surveys nascent entrepreneurs in the process of starting new ventures, overcoming potential survivorship and recall biases (<span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Gartner_2004.html','ref-target')">Gartner <i>et al.</i>, 2004</a></span><span class="niljax">Gartner <i>et al.</i>, 2004</span>). Data are available from the initial data collection round (A) and five follow-up waves (B–F) with the same nascent entrepreneurs. Each wave was completed approximately 1 year apart.<span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Renko_2017_ftn2.html','ref-target');">{2}</a></span><span class="niljax">{2}</span></p>
          <p>This study included all six “waves” of data collection. There are 1214 cases, but after dropping missing data on a case-wise basis, the analysis examined 1128 cases.</p>

          <h2>Measures</h2>
          <div id="new-firm">
            <h3>Dependent variable: New firm</h3>
            <p>If a respondent reported the creation of a new firm in any wave of the PSED study (PSED-II questions BA50-FA50), that case was scored as “true” for the new firm (NF) variable. 237 cases were scored as true, and 891 as false.</p>

            <h3>Independent variable (individual): Financial motivation</h3>
            <p>In the initial screening interview, respondents were asked about fourteen possible motivations for starting a new business on a 1-5 Likert scale. Three<span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Renko_2017_ftn3.html','ref-target');">{3}</a></span><span class="niljax">{3}</span> were related to financial motivations (<span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Cassar_2007.html','ref-target')">Cassar, 2007</a></span><span class="niljax">Cassar, 2007</span>; <span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Zanakis_2012.html','ref-target')">Zanakis <i>et</i> <i>al.</i>, 2012</a></span><span class="niljax">Zanakis <i>et</i> <i>al.</i>, 2012</span>; <span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Stephan_2015.html','ref-target')">Stephan <i>et</i> <i>al.</i>, 2015</a></span><span class="niljax">Stephan <i>et</i> <i>al.</i>, 2015</span>):</p>
            <p><i>Section W: “Please indicate the extent to which the following were important to you for establishing this new business.”</i></p>
            <p>AW6: “To give yourself, your spouse, and your children financial security.”</p>
            <p>AW9: “To earn a larger personal income.”</p>
            <p>AW12: “To have a chance to build great wealth or a very high income.”</p>
            <p>There was an adequate internal consistency (&alpha; = 0.79) between the three questions. These three responses were combined into a single variable by taking the mean of the three responses, and center-shifting that value. The resulting variable ranged from -2 to +2.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="expected-revenue">
            <h3>Independent variable (opportunity): Expected revenue</h3>
            <p>Respondents were asked, “Once this new business is operational, what is the total revenue or income expected in the first twelve months of operation?” in every wave of the PSED (AT2-FT2). So, there were cases with multiple responses. Presumably the accuracy of the estimation should improve over time. This refinement in estimations is apparent in the increasing correlation of responses between waves (all correlations are statistically significant at p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.001)<span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Renko_2017_ftn4.html','ref-target');">{4}</a></span><span class="niljax">{4}</span>.&nbsp; Therefore, the most recent non-NA response was used as the expected revenue for each case; this last response occurred in wave A in 44% of cases.&nbsp; It occurred in waves B-F for 20%, 11%, 6%, 6%, and 13% of cases, respectively.&nbsp; The values of expected revenues were non-normally distributed. To correct for this, all non-zero responses were converted to a base-10 log. The response was 0 for fifteen cases, which were included in the analysis.</p>
            <p>The log-responses were then converted to z-scores, resulting in the expected revenue variable.</p>

            <p>The responses for age and education (AH2_1 and AH6) were used without transformation and treated as continuous variables. There were ten levels of response for educational level, scored 1 to 10, with level 1 being “Up to eighth grade” and 10 being “Law, MD, PhD, EDD degree”.</p>
            <p>Previous startup experience (AH12_1) was measured with a dummy variable, with “true” indicating a greater-than-zero number of previous startups.</p>
            <p>There were six questions which allowed respondents to self-identify their racial/ethic background (AH3_1, AH4a_1, AH4b_1, AH4d_1, AH4e_1, and AH4f_1).<span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Renko_2017_ftn5.html','ref-target');">{5}</a></span><span class="niljax">{5}</span></p>
            <p>The questionnaire allows for five levels of response for marital status (AH5_1). For simplicity, these were reduced to two dummy variables. The first (Cmar) identifies if the respondent is currently married. The second (Nmar) identifies if the respondent has never been married. The implicit third state (both “false”) combines the rest of the levels.</p>
            <p>To check for industry-specific effects, the PSED II questions AB1-FB1 were scored as one of sixteen industries. The data subset had sixteen dummy variables–one for each industry—and cases were scored based on the most recent non-NA response.</p>

        <div id="logistic-regression-models">
          <h2>Logistic Regression Models</h2>
          <p>In order to examine the hypothesis, multivariate regression models were employed (<span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Edwards_1993.html','ref-target')">Edwards and Parry, 1993</a></span><span class="niljax">Edwards and Parry, 1993</span>). As the dependent variable (New firm) is binary, logistic regression models were used; in all, five models were tested. All models had n=1128.</p>
          <p>The ‘Controls Only Model’ contained the control variables that were not of interest to our hypothesis. The only ones that had statistically significant effects on new firm creation were AH3_1 (Hispanic/Latino), with p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;.05, and AH6_1 (educational level), with p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;.01.</p>
          <p>The ‘Directional Effects Model’ comprised all the variables in the Controls Only Model, along with the first-order variables for financial motivation and expected revenues. The expected revenue variable (Log-revenue) showed a high probability of statistical significance, p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;.001, yet the income motive variable (Centered-motive) failed to achieve statistical significance, as in Cassar (2007).&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The ‘Non-Directional Effects Model’ comprised all the variables in the Directional Effects Model, along with the second-order variables for financial motivation and expected revenues. Expected revenue was again statistically significant. Both of the directionless variables (the square of Centered-motive, and the square of Log-revenue) were statistically significant. This implies a directionality to the interaction between income motive and revenue expectation.</p>
          <p>The ‘Cross-Product Model’ comprised all the variables in the Directional Effects Model, along with the cross-product of the variables for financial motivation and expected revenues. It does not include the second-order variables that were included in the ‘Non-Directional Effects Model’. The same variables were statistically significant in this model as in the Directional Effects Model. The cross-product term for financial motivation and expected revenues was not statistically significant, showing that investigating the impact of the cross-product alone would not identify the relationship between financial motivation and expected revenues.</p>
          <p>The ‘Response Surface Model’ comprised all the control variables, and the first-order, second-order, and cross-product variables for financial motivation and expected revenues. The same variables were statistically significant in this model as in the Non-Directional Effects Model: educational level, expected revenue, and both of the squared, independent variables.</p>
            <iframe id="Table4"
                    width="100%"
                    frameborder="0"

          <p>The null deviance for all the models was 1159.8, while the individual model's residual deviance ranged from 1135.1 for the Controls Only Model to 1097.3 for the Response Surface Model. Since these are descriptive models, the margin of difference between the residual deviances of the models and the null model's residual deviance is not as important as the direction, and all the models offered a superior fit to the data compared to the null model, while the Response Surface Model fit the best.</p>
          <p>It is possible that the nascent process impacts revenue expectations, making expectations more positive for those individuals who are making progress towards a positive outcome (new firm start) and receiving encouraging feedback on the way there. In our main models we measure revenue expectations at the latest stage when they are reported in order to capture the most precise revenue estimates. This, however, means that some of those estimates may have been influenced by positive / negative feedback during the nascent process. <i>Post hoc</i>, we explored these possible influences and observed, first of all, that regardless of the ultimate outcome of the nascent process, revenue expectations adjust significantly downwards as time passes. This happens to both those entrepreneurs that eventually manage to start a business, and those who do not. This points to the likely development where all entrepreneurs’ estimates for their future business revenue become more accurate (realistic) over time. Second, we re-ran the logistic regression model with revenue expectation data captured at the time of the first PSED interview only (Wave A). The results remained starkly similar to those reported in Table 4 for the main data.&nbsp;</p>

        <div id="response-surface">
          <h2>Response surface</h2>
          <p>The response surface was calculated using the coefficients from the Response Surface Model for the variables of interest.&nbsp; To interpret the response surface we looked at the slope and curvature along the lines of maximum alignment and misalignment.&nbsp; The statistical significance of each of these was determined from the standard-errors and covariances of the independent variables, using standard methodology (<span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Edwards_1993.html','ref-target')">e.g., Edwards and Parry, 1993</a></span><span class="niljax">e.g., Edwards and Parry, 1993</span>; <span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Atwater_2005.html','ref-target')">Atwater <i>et al.</i>, 2005</a></span><span class="niljax">Atwater <i>et al.</i>, 2005</span>; <span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Shanock_2010.html','ref-target')">Shanock <i>et al.</i>, 2010</a></span><span class="niljax">Shanock <i>et al.</i>, 2010</span>).</p>

            <h3>Slope and curvature – Alignment (figure 2a)</h3>
            <p>The line highlighted in Figure 2a is the line of maximum alignment. The slope of this line of alignment is quantified as the sum of the coefficients of the first-order variables. For our model this was 0.555 (p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;.01). This statistically significant result indicates whether the impact of alignment is linear or not, when considered along with the line's curvature.</p>
            <p>The curvature of the line of alignment is quantified as the sum of the coefficients of the second-order and cross-product variables.&nbsp; For our model this was -0.300 (p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;.05).&nbsp; The negative, statistically significant result for the curvature in combination with the statistically significant result for the slope indicates that the alignment of financial motive and expected revenue impact the probability of a new firm in a non-linear way. Since the curvature is negative, the curve of the line is concave, and grows steeper with the increase in the magnitude of the variables.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="slope-and-curvature-misalignment">
            <h3>Slope and curvature – Misalignment (figure 2b)</h3>
            <p>The line highlighted in Figure 2b is the line of maximum misalignment. The slope of this line of misalignment is quantified as the difference of the coefficients of the first-order variables. For our model this was -0.347 (p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;.05).&nbsp; This statistically significant result indicates that when there is a misalignment between financial motivation and revenue expectation, the direction of the discrepancy matters. Having a negative slope means that the impact of misalignment is greater when financial motivation exceeds revenue expectations than when revenue expectations exceed financial motivation.</p>
            <p>The curvature of the line of misalignment is quantified as the sum of the coefficients of the second-order variables less the coefficient of the cross-product variable.&nbsp; For our model this was -0.385 (p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;.05). This statistically significant result indicates that the impact of a misalignment between financial motivation and revenue expectation increases as the size of that misalignment increases.<a name="curvature-of-centered-motivelog-revenue-" id="curvature-of-centered-motivelog-revenue-"></a></p>
            <p>As with the logistic regression, we also ran a <i>post hoc</i> response surface analysis using only Wave A revenue expectation data. In this, two of the four coefficients of the analysis were not statistically significant. This is most likely due to the wave A responses including a greater degree of random error (less precise estimates for revenue) than the last responses used in the main analysis.</p>

          <p>To test for the robustness of the models across industries, variables for financial motive, expected revenue and new firm creation were used as dependent variables, with industry as the independent variable to check for possible industry effects. Three models were tested, one for each of the dependent variables, with the 16 industry dummies as the independent variables.</p>
          <p>No industry variable had a probability of statistical significance lower than p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;.1 in either of the models with new firm creation or expected revenue as dependent variables. Two industry variables did achieve p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;.1 statistical significance when financial motivation was the dependent variable. Both of those industries—“Health, education or social services” and “Agriculture”—had a negative coefficient, meaning that respondents in those industries typically had lower financial motivations than in other industries. Given that the interaction of financial motivation and revenue expectation was found to be directional, the relatively weak statistical significance implies that leaving the industries in aggregate for the response surface analysis had little, if any, effect.</p>

        <h1>Discussion and Conclusions</h1>
        <p>Financial motivation is the taken-for-granted reason behind for-profit entrepreneurship. Hence, we found it interesting that previous research had found no relationship between this type of motivation and the outcomes of nascent entrepreneurs’ start-up processes (<span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Carter_2003.html','ref-target')">Carter <i>et al.</i>, 2003</a></span><span class="niljax">Carter <i>et al.</i>, 2003</span>; <span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Cassar_2007.html','ref-target')">Cassar, 2007</a></span><span class="niljax">Cassar, 2007</span>). Should not someone who is really eager to make money be more likely to establish a business than someone else who cares less about wealth?</p>
        <p>Reflecting on the importance of the individual–opportunity nexus, established in previous research (<span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Shane_2000.html','ref-target')">Shane and Venkataraman, 2000</a></span><span class="niljax">Shane and Venkataraman, 2000</span>), we realized that a shortcoming of much of the previous research on motivations of entrepreneurs was that they only accounted for the between-individual variation in financial motivations, but not the within-individual variation that arises during entrepreneurial opportunity evaluation (<span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Haynie_2010.html','ref-target')">Haynie <i>et al.</i>, 2010</a></span><span class="niljax">Haynie <i>et al.</i>, 2010</span>). Hence, we were driven to investigate how the alignment between an entrepreneur’s financial motivation and the revenue potential of the opportunity they were pursuing would relate to the outcomes of their nascent venturing process. Similar to previous research (<span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Carter_2003.html','ref-target')">Carter <i>et al.</i>, 2003</a></span><span class="niljax">Carter <i>et al.</i>, 2003</span>; <span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Cassar_2007.html','ref-target')">Cassar, 2007</a></span><span class="niljax">Cassar, 2007</span>; <span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Zanakis_2012.html','ref-target')">Zanakis <i>et al.</i>, 2012</a></span><span class="niljax">Zanakis <i>et al.</i>, 2012</span>), we used the Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics (PSED II) data to empirically investigate this idea, using response surface analysis. Our hypothesis, “<i>The less aligned a nascent entrepreneur's financial motivation is with the expected financial reward from the business opportunity, the lower the likelihood of starting a business</i>” was confirmed by the statistically significant result for the curvature along the line of perfect discrepancy, that is, where quantified financial motivation was the exact negative of quantified revenue expectation. The negative slope of that same line allows us to also state that, “the discrepancy is more detrimental when high financial motivations are coupled with low revenue expectations.” This, we believe, is key to understanding why previous research on financial motivation has not been able to establish a link to positive outcomes among nascent entrepreneurs (<span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Carter_2003.html','ref-target')">Carter <i>et al.</i>, 2003</a></span><span class="niljax">Carter <i>et al.</i>, 2003</span>; <span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Cassar_2007.html','ref-target')">Cassar, 2007</a></span><span class="niljax">Cassar, 2007</span>; <span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Zanakis_2012.html','ref-target')">Zanakis <i>et al.</i>, 2012</a></span><span class="niljax">Zanakis <i>et al.</i>, 2012</span>). Having a strong financial motivation, that is, stating that they put great importance on achieving financial security, earning a large income, and building wealth, is detrimental to an individual’s progress with a startup unless the very opportunity they pursue has a high revenue potential. Such opportunities are rare; the typical business opportunities pursued by average American entrepreneurs result in small businesses that seldom make the entrepreneurs very rich (<span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Reynolds_2007.html','ref-target')">Reynolds, 2007</a></span><span class="niljax">Reynolds, 2007</span>).</p>
        <p>Besides giving an empirical explanation to surprising findings of previous research, at a fundamental level our study also speaks to the importance of the individual–opportunity nexus in entrepreneurship. That the alignment of opportunity revenue expectations and individual motivations was able to predict the creation of a new firm is aligned with much of the previous work on the importance of this nexus (<span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Shane_2000.html','ref-target')">Shane and Venkataraman, 2000</a></span><span class="niljax">Shane and Venkataraman, 2000</span>; <span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Sarason_2006.html','ref-target')">Sarason <i>et al.</i>, 2006</a></span><span class="niljax">Sarason <i>et al.</i>, 2006</span>; <span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/McMullen_2006.html','ref-target')">McMullen and Shepherd, 2006</a></span><span class="niljax">McMullen and Shepherd, 2006</span>; <span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Gregoire_2012.html','ref-target')">Grégoire and Shepherd, 2012</a></span><span class="niljax">Grégoire and Shepherd, 2012</span>). Furthermore, while previous research has suggested that entrepreneurs are attracted to opportunities that are complementary to their existing knowledge resources (<span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Dimov_2007.html','ref-target')">e.g., Dimov, 2007</a></span><span class="niljax">e.g., Dimov, 2007</span>; <span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Haynie_2010.html','ref-target')">Haynie <i>et al.</i>, 2010</a></span><span class="niljax">Haynie <i>et al.</i>, 2010</span>), our research suggests that the same logic can also be expanded to entrepreneurs’ motivations. We find that nascent entrepreneurs persist and push through the challenges of starting up when their personal financial motivation is aligned with the financial potential of the opportunity.</p>
        <p>In terms of methodology, we have demonstrated that response-surface analysis is a useful way to account for the heterogeneity of opportunities in an examination of the entrepreneurial phenomenon.&nbsp; Where-as entrepreneur-side-only research found no significant influence of financial motivations (Cassar 2007), our “dualistic” approach does indeed provide additional insight, as predicted by Sarason <i>et</i> <i>al.</i> (2006). Because of our reliance on the secondary PSED data, we were only able to test the alignment hypothesis regarding financial motivation. A number of other important entrepreneurial motivations have been identified in previous literature, such as self-realization, recognition, innovation, and independence (<span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Edelman_2010.html','ref-target')">Edelman <i>et al.</i>, 2010</a></span><span class="niljax">Edelman <i>et al.</i>, 2010</span>). Future research should look into alignment between these types of motivations and related, relevant opportunity characteristics to further confirm our findings.</p>
        <p>Finally, our findings align with the importance of person-situation fit, conceptualized as person-job and person-organization fit in the organizational behavior domain. Research in that domain suggests that the fit between what an individual values, and what their job offers, goes a long way in explaining individual’s performance and persistence (<span class="ajax"><a onclick="fetchText('ajax/Kristof-Brown_2005.html','ref-target')">Kristof-Brown <i>et al.</i>, 2005</a></span><span class="niljax">Kristof-Brown <i>et al.</i>, 2005</span>). Future research in entrepreneurship should explore the variety of consequences that the person-opportunity fit may have in the startup context.</p>
        <p>As a conclusion, our study has shown that individual’s financial motivation for starting up matters, but with a caveat: Only when this motivation and the potential financial rewards from the pursued opportunity are aligned, individual nascent entrepreneurs are more likely to start businesses.</p><br clear="all">
