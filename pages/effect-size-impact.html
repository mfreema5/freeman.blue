      <h2>Implications of the size of effect on significance testing</h2>
      <article>
        <p>
          Descriptions of what the “effect size” is can sometimes be esoteric, but since we've limited ourselves to talking about linear regressions that use null-hypothesis significance testing, we can simply say that it's the correlation that exist in the population.
        </p>

          The somewhat confusing thing is that most of the time we don't know the value of the <i>effect size</i>—since if we knew the population correlation, we wouldn't need to be trying to find a sample correlation—yet we need to know its value in order to determine the <i>statistical power</i> of an analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
          One mistake that you might make is to use your sample correlation as an estimate of the population correlation, which is the <i>effect size</i>. Doing that defeats the main purpose of <i>statistical power</i>, since you are forcing it to always be 50%. A <i>statistical power</i> of 50% is of effectively no use in avoiding or discussing Type II errors.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, regardless of what method you use to determine <i>effect size</i>, if you don't use it to calculate <i>statistical power</i> until after you've collected and analyzed your data, you've already missed out on the chance to use it to help determine the right <i>sample size</i> for your study.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's go back to the basic example graphic (<a class= "framejump" target="Mframe" href="main-sideways-graphics.html#Figure12">Figure 12</a>) that shows both the population and the sample probability curves for some hypothetical linear regression.
        </p>
        <p>
          The statistical power is the shaded area “under” the sample probability curve of the left side of the graph. The size of that area is determined by two things: the shape of the probability curves, and the distance between the lines that bisects the curves.
        </p>
        <p>
          The two curves are identical, and are a result of the <i>sample size</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The height of the line that bisects the population probability curve on the right side of the graph is a result of the shape of the probability curves combined with the <em>confidence level</em> of the analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
          The height of the line that bisects the sample probability curve is the <i>effect size</i> of the analysis, a.k.a., the population correlation.
        </p>
        <p>
          In general, a larger sample size will give you a larger statistical power. Think of it this way: if the two bisecting lines (the sample and population correlations) are a great distance apart, then even if the probability curves are wide and low, there will be a large area that's between the bisection lines. But if the two lines are close together, the probability curves will need to be very tight in order to find a large area between the two bisecting lines. See the next example graphic, (<a class= "framejump" target="Mframe" href="main-sideways-graphics.html#Figure13">Figure 13</a>).
