      <h1>Interaction of <i>alpha</i> and <i>beta</i></h1>
      <h1>Finding a balance between Type I and Type II errors</h1>
      <article>
        <p>
          <a class= "framejump" target="Gframe" href="alpha-beta-graphics.html#Figure01">Figure 01</a> has three curves in it, showing three different values for <i>alpha</i>. The three probability curves are all identical, but the value of the sample correlation increases from left to right. That increase in the sample correlation shifts the curve upward (in our sideways view) and that means that the value for <i>alpha</i> decreases, since the percentage of the area “under” the probability curve that is bounded by the null line decreases.
        </p>

          This is what you would expect to happen. Remember that <i>alpha</i>, a.k.a., the “confidence level”, or “<i>p</i> value”, indicates the probability that the population correlation is not null. Which is another way of saying that it measures the chances that the correlation is “real”, and not a result of random error. And yet another way of looking at it is to say that <i>alpha</i> is a measure of the chance of making a “Type I” error.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, the larger the sample correlation is, the less likely it is that no such correlation exists in the population, and that all you have found is random error. If the sample correlation is quite small, it's easy to believe that the correlation is the result of sampling errors, because it wouldn't take much error to create the illusion of a small correlation. But it would take a very large and therefore unlikely amount of sampling error to create the illusion of a large correlation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next graphic, <a class= "framejump" target="Gframe" href="alpha-beta-graphics.html#Figure02">Figure 02</a>, has three graphs in it, with the statistical power increasing from left to right, while <i>beta</i> is decreasing.
        </p>
        <div class="w3072">
          <img src="images/large/three-betas.svg" alt="Figure 02: Three values for beta" />
          <a href="images/three-betas.html"><img class="button" src="images/full-screen-button.svg" alt="Show full size" /></a>
          <p>Figure 02</p>
        </div>
        <p>
          The value for <i>alpha</i> is the same for all three graphs, and therefore the minimum sample correlation that is statistically significant is also the same for all three. The statistical power increases because the population correlation increases. As it gets higher in the sideways graph, it gets farther away from the minimum statistically significant sample correlation, and therefore the proportion of the area “under” the sample probability curve that has that minimum correlation as a lower bound gets larger.
        </p>
        <p>
          The shape of the sample probability curve on the left side of the graph perfectly mirrors the shape of the population probability curve on the right side of the graph. They will always be perfect mirrors, because they are both defined by the same thing: the <i>sample size</i>, a.k.a., “N”.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the page <a href="sample-size-impact.html">Impact of sample size</a> we'll look at how sample size determines the shape of those probability curves.
