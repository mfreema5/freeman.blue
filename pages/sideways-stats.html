        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          This page is the result of me wanting to understand these four characteristics of linear regressions:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>confidence level / alpha</li>
          <li>statistical power / beta</li>
          <li>sample size</li>
          <li>effect size</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          I wanted to know not only what they are, but how they are related to each other, since they all come up in discussions of statistical significance. More specifically, in discussions of the use of null-hypothesis significance testing as part of empirical studies in the social sciences. I've been obsessed with null-hypothesis significance testing for a while now, to the point where it almost derailed my Master's thesis in technical communication (<a href='http://www.freeman.blue/papers/finding-research-value-thesis-MJF.html'>“Finding Research Value &ndash; the metrics and methods for evaluating research”</a>).

        <p>
          To be able to make rational arguments about null-hypothesis significance testing, I needed to understand those four inter-related characteristics of linear regressions.  But none of the explanations I was reading in a variety of books were working for me.  Since I'm a visual thinker, I came up with a way to represent the relationship between those four characteristics graphically.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think that I understand them now, but the best way to check if you understand something is to try to explain it to someone else. So, these web-pages are an attempt to explain the graphics I've come up with, and how I use them to understand the four significance-related characteristics of linear regressions.

You should confirm the validity of anything you read here before applying it. Especially since my interest in the use of these four characteristics of statistical analysis is a narrow one.

        <h2>What are “sideways” statistics?</h2>
        <p>
          I've called this “Sideways statistics” because of the graphics I use to help myself understand the four significance-related characteristics of linear regressions, such as <a class= "framejump" target="Mframe" href="main-sideways-graphics.html#Figure01">Figure 01</a>.
        </p>
        <div class="w1008" id="Standard_deviation_diagram">
          <img src="images/large/Standard_deviation_diagram.svg" alt="Figure 02a: Probability curve" />
          <p>Figure 02</p>
        </div>
        <p>
          To explain how I got to the graphics such as in <a class= "framejump" target="Mframe" href="main-sideways-graphics.html#Figure01">Figure 01</a>, let's start with a graph of a standard probability curve, <a class= "framejump" target="Mframe" href="main-sideways-graphics.html#Figure02">Figure 02</a> (adapted from <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Standard_deviation_diagram.svg">a graphic</a> on Wikimedia Commons).  I'm assuming you've seen something like it before.  If you haven't, you might want to take at look at the <i><a href="probability-curves-primer.html">Probability Distributions Primer</a></i> before continuing.
        </p>
        <div class="w1008">
          <img src="images/large/basic-prob-alpha.svg" alt="Figure 03: Basic correlation with alpha = 5%" />
          <a href="images/basic-prob-alpha.html"><img class="button" src="images/full-screen-button.svg" alt="Show full size" /></a>
          <p>Figure 03a</p>
        </div>
        <p>
          The horizontal axis is the possible values for some measure. The vertical axis is the probability of getting each value on the horizontal axis when you make a measurement. Typically, however, we aren't interested in the probability of a specific value, but rather we're interested in the probability of getting a result in a range; in other words, a result that is “greater than or equal to” or that is “less than or equal to” some value.
        </p>
        <p>
          The probability of getting a result that is bounded by a specific value is equal to the total area under the curve on the appropriate side of that value. In <a class= "framejump" target="Mframe" href="main-sideways-graphics.html#Figure03a">Figure 03a</a>, the the shaded area is the probability of getting a result that's “less than or equal to” the bounding value.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the case of linear regression, the probability that comes up most often is the “<i>p</i> value”, a.k.a, “alpha”, “confidence level”, etc. In the social sciences, the most common value for <i>alpha</i> is 5%, often reported as “<i>p</i>&lt;.05”.  The shaded area in <a class= "framejump" target="Mframe" href="main-sideways-graphics.html#Figure03a">Figure 03a</a> is 5% of the total area.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you're using a null-hypothesis significance test to analyze a sample, a confidence level of 95% means that there is a 95% chance that population correlation is not zero. You don't precisely know the population correlation because you measured and analyzed only a sample of the population, instead of the entire population. So, what you've found is the sample correlation, and the population correlation is related to the sample correlation by a probability curve.
        </p>
        <div class="w1536">
          <img src="images/large/basic-prob-alpha-sideways.svg" alt="Figure 03b: Sideways correlation with alpha = 5%" />
          <a href="images/basic-prob-alpha-sideways.html"><img class="button" src="images/full-screen-button.svg" alt="Show full size" /></a>
          <p>Figure 03b</p>
        </div>
        <p>
          In <a class= "framejump" target="Mframe" href="main-sideways-graphics.html#Figure03a">Figure 03a</a>, we'll say that the mean value of the probability curve is the value of a sample correlation of some analysis. The probability curve therefore shows what values the <em>population</em> correlation may have, based on the <em>sample</em> correlation value. In <a class= "framejump" target="Mframe" href="main-sideways-graphics.html#Figure03a">Figure 03a</a>, 5% of the total area under the curve is bounded by a measured value of <span class="glow">zero</span>. So, there is a 5% probability that the population correlation is “less than or equal to” zero. (That's not quite the same as the “null” in “null hypothesis significance testing”, but for now we'll treat it like it is. And everything still works out properly if we do.  See the section on <a href="#type-i-errors">Type I errors</a> for why it works.)
        </p>
        <p>
          You can take the previous example graphic and stand it up on end, as is shown in <a class= "framejump" target="Mframe" href="main-sideways-graphics.html#Figure03b">Figure 03b</a>. Doing so puts the zero/null line at the bottom of the graph, and makes the horizontal axis the probabilities of the curve. Meanwhile, the vertical axis becomes the value of correlations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why is this is a useful convention?  Because when you're designing a study that will use a linear regression analysis, there are two probability curves involved, and the “sideways” arrangment makes it easier to see the relationship between them, because we can place them next to each other, such as in <a class= "framejump" target="Mframe" href="main-sideways-graphics.html#Figure04">Figure 04</a>.
        </p>
        <div class="w1008">
          <img src="images/large/basic-prob-alpha-sideways-dual.svg" alt="Figure 04: Comparing two sideways graphs" />
          <a href="images/basic-prob-alpha-sideways-dual.html"><img class="button" src="images/full-screen-button.svg" alt="Show full size" /></a>
          <p>Figure 04</p>
        </div>
        <p>
          The first curve that's involved describes the sample correlation you're likely to find when you do the analysis.  Its location is determined by the population correlation.  The second curve describes the population correlation.  Its location is determined by the sample correlation that you get from your analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
          The more common way to refer to these two probability curves is through the characteristics  “alpha” and “beta”.  As was mentioned above, <i>alpha</i> is also referred to as the “<i>p</i> value”, or the “confidence level”, etc.  <i>Alpha</i> is a proportion of the population probability curve.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other characteristic, <i>beta</i>, is a proportion of the sample probability curve.  Often, “beta” is described as the proportion of the sample probability curve that is <em>not</em> the “statistical power”.  More simply, ‘1 - &beta; = statistical power’.  In sideways statistics, it's easier to just say that the sample probability curve will be divided into two parts.  One of those is <i>beta</i>, the other is the <i>statistical power</i>.  (And that's why they always add up to 100%&mdash;because each is just one of two proportions of the total area.)
        </p>
        <section class="digression">
          <h4>But I don't know the population correlation, do I?<span class="show-expansion" id="show_popcorr"><a onclick="setDisplay('show_popcorr','none'); setDisplay('popcorr','inline-block')">&nbsp;&hellip;&nbsp;</a></span></small></h4>
          <span class="expansion" id="popcorr"><p>
            It may seem somewhat confusing to talk about the population correlation as defining the location of the sample probability curve, since if you knew the exact population correlation, you wouldn't need to be doing a linear regression to demonstrate what it is.  The thing to keep in mind is that the population correlation exists irrespective of whether or not you know what it is, since that correlation is an intrinsic property of whatever phenomenon it is you're studying.  So, in practice, you typically come up with some way to estimate the population correlation, and then use that estimate to find the <i>beta</i> and the <i>statistical power</i> of your analysis.<a onclick="setDisplay('show_popcorr','inline'); setDisplay('popcorr','none')">&nbsp;<b>&#x2190;</b>&nbsp;</a>
          </p></span>
        </section>
        <p>
          So, the major reason for making these example graphics “sideways” is to make it easier to understand the relationship of these two probability curves. By making them vertical, we can put them “back-to-back” and therefore see how the characteristics of <i>alpha</i>, <i>beta</i>, <i>sample size</i>, and <i>effect size</i> are related to each other.

        <h2>Probability curves and linear regression</h2>
        <p>
          The last part of the previous section, that discusses probability curves, along with <i>alpha</i> and <i>beta</i> is not, for me at least, intuitively obvious, so let's go over it again.  (If it already makes sense to you, you might skip ahead to <em><a href="#alpha-beta-effects">&lsquo;Confidence level &amp; statistical power&rsquo;</a></em>.)
        </p>
        <div class="w1008" id="population-probability">

          <p>Figure 05 &ndash; Sample correlation bisects population probability curve</p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Let's say you measure a variety of characteristics of a presumably representative sample of a population. You can do a linear regression analysis of the measurements, and precisely calculate the correlations between the characteristics you measured. But, your results are only precise descriptions of the sample. They aren't precise descriptions of the population, because there is always some amount of error, some amount of potential discrepancy, between the mean value of some characteristic for a sample, and the mean value of that characteristic for the population.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, you can't precisely determine the correlation between characteristics for the population. But what you can determine precisely is the probability that the population's correlation falls within some range of values. In the case of null-hypothesis significance testing, your goal is to calculate the probability that the population correlation is not zero. When you report that a correlation is, e.g., “statistically significant at ‘p&lt;.05’”, you're reporting the probability that you calculated—based on the sample correlation—that the magnitude of the population's correlation is greater than zero. In the case of ‘p&lt;.05’, that probability is 0.95, in other words, 95%.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can think about that probability calculation as being a probability curve that you draw around the sample correlation. In <a class= "framejump" target="Mframe" href="main-sideways-graphics.html#Figure05">Figure 05</a>, the horizontal line that splits the curve marks the value of the sample correlation. The probability curve itself, however, describes the correlation of the population.
        </p>
        <div class="w1008">
          <img src="images/large/sample-probability.svg" alt="Figure 06: Sample probability around population correlation" />
          <a href="images/sample-probability.html"><img class="button" src="images/full-screen-button.svg" alt="Show full size" /></a>
          <p>Figure 06 &ndash; Population correlation bisects sample probability curve</p>
        </div>
        <p>
          This is an important distinction to understand. In <a class= "framejump" target="Mframe" href="main-sideways-graphics.html#Figure05">Figure 05</a>, the straight line is about the <em>sample</em>. The curve is about the <em>population</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          (<a class= "framejump" target="Mframe" href="main-sideways-graphics.html#Figure06">Figure 06</a> is the opposite of that. The straight line is about the <em>population</em>. The curve is about the <em>sample</em>. They are both on the opposite side of the vertical axis from the previous graph because they show the opposite relationship.
        </p>
        <p>
          What is that relationship? It's the probability of finding some particular value for a sample correlation, based on what the population correlation is. Even though you may not be able to ever directly measure the population correlation, it does exist and it does have some value. And that value establishes the probabilities of the sample correlation value you'll find.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sample probability curve is described by <i>beta</i>, and/or “statistical power”.  The population probability curve, which was in <a class= "framejump" target="Mframe" href="main-sideways-graphics.html#Figure05">Figure 05</a>, is described by <i>alpha</i>, a.k.a. “confidence level” or “<i>p</i> value”.

        <h2>[Some other title]</h2>

        <div class="w1008">

          <a class= "framejump" target="Mframe" href="main-sideways-graphics.html#Figure08">Figure 08</a> takes advantage of the sideways arrangment, and shows both the population and the sample probability curves for some hypothetical linear regression.
        </p>
        <p>
          The curve on the <strong>right</strong> is the <strong>population</strong> probability curve, and 5% of its area is below the null line. Therefore, the line that bisects that curve marks the lowest sample correlation that would be statistically significant at “<i>p</i>&lt;.05”.
        </p>
        <p>
          The curve on the <strong>left</strong> is the <strong>sample</strong> probability curve. And the shaded portion of its area is the value of the <i>statistical power</i> of the analysis. The unshaded area is the value of <i>beta</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the right side of the graphic, which has the population probability curve, the value of <i>alpha</i> is equal to the area bounded by the null line (see: <i><a href="#type-i-errors">Sideways Type I errors</a></i>). On the left side, which has the sample probability curve, the value of <i>beta</i> is equal to the area bounded by the line that bisects the curve on the right. Again, that line is the minimum statistically significant sample correlation at a 95% confidence level.
        </p>
        <p>
          The line that bisects the sample probability curve on the left side of the graph is the population correlation value. The probability curve around it describes the sample correlation that you will find. In the graphic, if we assume that the shaded portion of the area is 60% of the total area, then the graph indicates that if we take a sample of that population and test it for a correlation, there is a 60% chance that we will find a statistically significant correlation (<i>p</i>&lt;.05).
        </p>
        <p>
          In other words, the fact that 60% of the sample correlation probability curve is higher than the minimum statistically significant sample correlation value (<i>p</i>&lt;.05), means that there is a 60% chance that the sample correlation we find will be a value that is equal to or greater than that minimum value.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h2>[title]</h2>
        <p>
          So, we've seen how <i>alpha</i> determines the placement of the population probability curve. We now know that the shape of the population probability curve is determined by <i>sample size</i>. So, between <i>sample size</i> and <i>alpha</i>, the minimum sample correlation that is statistically significant is determined. And that minimum correlation sets the lower bound for determining the <i>statistical power</i> of the analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just like with the population probability curve, the shape of the sample probability curve is determined by <i>sample size</i>. So with <i>sample size</i> and the minimum statistically significant sample correlation that is determined by <i>sample size</i> and <i>alpha</i> we are almost able to determine the <i>statistical power</i>. All we need to do is figure out where the line that bisects the sample probability curve falls on our sideways graph.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've been referring to that line as the population correlation. Because I wanted to maintain symmetry in my descriptions of the sideways statistical graphics. So, since the right side of the graph has the population probability curve that is bisected by the sample correlation, the left side of the graph which has the sample probability curve should be bisected by something called the “population correlation”.
        </p>
        <p>
          But that line is also the last of the four characteristics of linear regressions that I set out to discuss—the “effect size”. That's what the next section will cover.
